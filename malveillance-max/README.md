# Malveillance Max - Ecrire des malwares pour Windows et Linux (FR)

introductory talk on how to get started in malware, a brief overview of the
history of malware in genral, as well as two examples:
- windows shellcode loader in golang (as well as a simple implant)
- linux keylogger

this talk was meant for IT students, and was completed in my school some time last year.
